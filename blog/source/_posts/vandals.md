Before I say anything else, I'd like to offer a big thank you to the Nissan Juke driver on Boxing Day who decided it would be fun to play Chicken with myself and Harley on a road without a path (quite common in the country...) I appreciate you obviously had a very important mission that day and any time lost through slowing down and actually giving me some room would have resulted in you being critically late. So let me apologise for walking my dog and causing you such problems...

This is really a post the I shouldn't bother writing. After all, the people it is aimed at will never read a blog. Mind you, I suppose it helps to get a couple of things off my chest.

Firstly, why oh why does fast food = fast disposal? By that I mean out of your vehicle's window... Everywhere I walk I see discarded McDonalds wrappers, plastic coffee cups, chip wrappers, drink cans and bottles. The list goes on. I suppose walking the dog means I notice the rubbish more (Harley certainly sniffs it out in short time!) but is it that hard to keep it in your car until you arrive home?

Secondly, I have another sarcastic vote of thanks to broadcast.
