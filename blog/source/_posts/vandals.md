Before I say anything else, I'd like to offer a big thank you to the Nissan Juke driver on Boxing Day who decided it would be fun to play Chicken with myself and Harley on a road without a path (quite common in the country...) I appreciate you obviously had a very important mission that day and any time lost through slowing down and actually giving me some room would have resulted in you being critically late. So let me apologise for walking my dog and causing you such problems...

This is really a post the I shouldn't bother writing. After all, the people it is aimed at will never read a blog. Mind you, I suppose it helps to get a couple of things off my chest.

Firstly, why oh why does fast food = fast disposal? By that I mean out of your vehicle's window as soon as it's been consumed. On my daily walks with the dog I see discarded McDonalds bags, plastic coffee cups, chip wrappers, drink cans and bottles. The list goes on. I suppose whilst perambulating I notice the rubbish more (Harley certainly sniffs it out in short time!) but there still seems to ba an awful lot of it Is it that hard to keep it in your car until you arrive home?

Secondly, I have another sarcastic vote of thanks to broadcast. (Me? Sarcastic?) This time to the delightful person who attempted to gain entry to an Openreach cabinet, but merely succeeded in breaking the key off in the lock. Why does this bother me? Well, I'd just negotiated an offer with Sky to switch my phone and Broadband to them for half the cost of my existing agreement and twice the speed. Sky failed to meet the original change date as the order originally raised included giving me a new phone number. As I've had the current one for over 20 years, I was loathe to change it. The system does not allow a telephone number to be amended, so the order had to be cancelled and a new one raised. This took almost 3 weeks.

The upshot meant I was due to switch providers on Fri 22nd December. Now do you start to see why I'm so happy with the key vandal? Correct. My old brodband provider terminated my connection at 13:00 but Openreach were unable to implement my shiny new connection as they couldn't get into the cabinet. A locksmith would be needed and it's now Christmas. No broadband until 2nd Jan 2018... I didn't find this out until the saturday as I waited until midnight as advised by Sky themselves. It would have been nice to have been advised by Sky of the problem, rather than having to phone and wait, but hey ho. I know there's nothing Sky can do.

At least I have a brilliant next door neighbour who kindly let me share his wifi connection so I'm not completely impotent, internet-wise.
